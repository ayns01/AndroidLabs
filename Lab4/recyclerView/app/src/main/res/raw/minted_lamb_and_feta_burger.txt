In Step 2, to easily strip thyme leaves off the stems, poke the bottom end of a stem through a small hole of a fine mesh strainer. Pull the stem through the hole and the leaves will strip off into the strainer!

Wash and dry all produce.* Strip 1/2 tbsp thyme leaves oï¬€ the stems. In a medium pot, add the farro, half the stripped thyme leaves and 3 cups water. Bring to a boil (uncovered) over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the farro is tender, 14-16 min.
